COMMENTS SEARCH README
Module version 1.01

The Comments Search module is a module for the XOOPS website content management system.

The module contains only a search function which provides 
searching XOOPS comments.
The module appears in Advanced Search options as a checkbox 
with a module name (DB_COMMENTS_NAME language string). The module has no contents, 
no admin options, no any other stuff.

NOTICE - $modversion['hasMain'] = 1;
The module comes with hasMain option turned on. This allows setting group permissions 
to the module (usually you want e.g. anonymous users to be able to search comments too -
- XOOPS 2.0.7 presents in search form only those modules which are accessible by a particular
user). However, setting hasMain causes the module appear in system menu. To prevent appearing 
Comments entry in XOOPS system menu, in Module Admin set Module Order to 0 - that will make 
the module invisible.
